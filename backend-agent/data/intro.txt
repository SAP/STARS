Hello there!
I can help you with assessing security of **Large Language Models**.

### Vulnerability Scans

I can run a **vulnerability scan** against a Large Language Model of your choice.
For that I will run a number of attacks against the Large Language Model:
- promptmap to identify Prompt Injections
- PyRIT to try to leak the System Prompt and to get the model to generate
  malicious content, e.g., writing a phishing email
- CodeAttack to run a prompt Injection Attack hidden in a code completion task.
  As CodeAttack includes hundreds of test prompts, a quick version (i.e., running
  only 20 test prompts) will be run as part of the vulnerability scan.

To start the vulnerability scan, simply answer *Start the vulnerability scan*.

### Individual attacks

I can run individual parameters with custom parameters.
Say the name of the attack and I will ask for further details if required.
Supported attacks are:
- promptmap
- gptfuzz
- PyRIT
- CodeAttack
- ArtPrompt
- dan (with garak)
- encoding (with garak)
- goodside (with garak)
- latentinjection (with garak)
- malwaregen (with garak)
- phrasing (with garak)
- promptinject (with garak)
- suffix (with garak)

### Attacks against Natural language processing models

I can run attacks against NLP models using textattack. Ask me for more information.
